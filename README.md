# iSpindelServerGUI
Windows server for iSpindel med GUI.
Open with Visual studio and publish.
Install on a 24/7 running Windows server.
Copy Excel template file to a location of your choice.
Edit Excel file and expand data range to expected needed size (max 200 lines).
Start, select Excel file and click 'Start server.
Configure your iSpindel to send to your server's IP and port 35419 (or change port in the program).
The porgram will now add entries received from your iSpindel, and Excel will add to the graph.
(The program has a primitive graph showing the angle, if you prefer not to use Excel. That may be improved.)
